# heart-data-analysis
Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on health attributes using machine learning. It utilizes a dataset of health metrics to build and evaluate predictive models.

Features
Machine Learning Models: Implemented using Python with Scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras.
Data Analysis: Explored relationships between health attributes and heart disease incidence.
Predictive Accuracy: Evaluated model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Usage
Input: Users can input health attributes to predict heart disease likelihood.
Output: Model provides predictions based on input attributes.
Next Steps
Fine-tune model parameters for improved accuracy.
